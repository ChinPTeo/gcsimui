    Credits where credist are due, this project could not have been possible
    without the following (in no particular order):
    <ul class="m-4">
      <li>
        Yukarix#6534, Aluminum#5462 and Terrapin#8603 for all the help early on
        with the projectï¼Œbeing the first folks to try it out and write some
        action lists (and finding all sorts of unspeakable bugs)
      </li>
      <li>
        Tsym#2586 for helping push the project along and implementing a lot of
        the missing characters
      </li>
      <li>
        frzyc#3029 for lots of coding inspirations and also not saying anything

      </li>
      <li>
        Algoinde#4180 and Mimee#1111 for a ton of styling help. This thing only
